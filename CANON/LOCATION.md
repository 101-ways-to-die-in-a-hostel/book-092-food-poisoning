**Name:** Nong (nickname)

**Role in death:** Oblivious - wasn't working when breakfast was served

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Unnamed older Thai woman | Comes twice weekly, does minimal |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | "Big" (Thai man, 40s) | Makes breakfast, no food safety training, well-meaning but careless |
| Manager | Absentee (Bangkok) | Responds to emergencies only |

### Staff Knowledge
Big knows the eggs were from yesterday. Thinks reheating makes them safe. Has served questionable food before without incident. Has no idea about botulism or proper food storage. When confronted, will blame the supplier.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Recovery mode. Travelers sleeping off hangovers. Occasional yoga session in common area. Breakfast stragglers until 11 AM. Heat keeps most people at beach or in hammocks.

### Night Vibe
Pre-party central. Drinking games. Planning which beach party to hit. Groups forming for shared taxis. Drugs offered discreetly. Loud until 3-4 AM.

### Guest Demographics
80% under 30, mostly Western (British, Australian, German, American). Mix of party tourists and yoga retreat spillover. Some long-term stays (digital nomads hiding from real life).

### Reputation
Online reviews: "Great vibe, basic facilities" "Breakfast is meh but it's free!" "Location is everything" "Got food poisoning but still 4 stars because BEACH" "Don't eat the eggs - I learned the hard way (minor sick, survived)"

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Ferry from Surat Thani (mainland) or Koh Samui. Songthaew (shared taxi truck) from pier. Hostel not well-signed, Google Maps usually gets you close.

### Check-in Process
Passport photo, cash payment preferred (card machine often broken), room assignment based on availability, no keys (lockers available, bring own lock).

### Rules
"Be cool, have fun" is the only stated rule. Unofficially: don't do hard drugs openly, don't steal from other travelers, don't bring locals back.

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: terrible, barely functional)
- [x] Kitchen (use at own risk)
- [x] Lockers
- [ ] Laundry (nearby service, not onsite)
- [ ] Pool
- [x] Bar

- [x] Tours offered (Full Moon Party tickets, snorkeling trips via third party)

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Koh Phangan's backpacker scene is accurately depicted. Food safety issues are common but usually result in "travelers' stomach" rather than fatal poisoning. The scenario exaggerates a real risk for dramatic effect.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Don't portray Thai staff as malicious - they're undertrained and under-resourced, not evil. The systemic issue is infrastructure and tourism speed outpacing regulation.
