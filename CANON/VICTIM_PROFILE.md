## The Fatal Flaw

- Brings protein powder but not antacids
- Lectures others on health while making dangerous choices
- Believes her "strong immune system" makes her invincible

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Disciplined - becomes rigid and judgmental about food
2. Encouraging to others - becomes condescending about health choices

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Arrogance about her body's capabilities - leads to ignoring warning signs
2. Performative wellness - leads to eating for content rather than safety

### Pet Peeves
- People who don't track their food
- Artificial ingredients in anything

### Fears
- Surface fear: Gaining weight while traveling
- Deeper fear: Being ordinary, losing relevance

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in suburban Minneapolis in a family that struggled with obesity and diabetes. Lost 60 pounds in college and made her transformation her entire identity. Built a following of 340,000 on Instagram. Never recovered from being the fat kid; every meal is a battle against her past self.

### Why They Travel
"Wellness retreat content" - traveling through Southeast Asia visiting yoga retreats and healthy cafes for sponsored content. Also escaping a recent breakup she hasn't told her followers about.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
The yoga retreat fell through last minute (scam). Booked the cheapest available option to save money for content-worthy experiences. "It's just one night."

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "macro-friendly," "gains," "fuel your body," "clean eating," "mindful"
- Avoids words like: "diet" (it's a "lifestyle"), "fat" (it's "fluffy")
- Catchphrases: "Your body is a temple!" / "No excuses!" / "We rise by lifting others!"

### Speech Pattern
- Upbeat, positive, slightly manic energy
- Everything ends with an exclamation point
- Valley girl inflection mixed with fitness jargon

### Internal Monologue Style
Constantly calculating: calories in, calories out, steps taken, protein consumed. Narrates her life as Instagram captions.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (primary), TikTok (growing)
- **Follower count:** 342,000
- **Posting style:** Perfectly lit meals, workout videos, "candid" laughing shots
- **Last post before death:** Photo of hostel breakfast with caption "Sometimes you just gotta work with what you've got! Making gains even on a budget! Egg whites = protein = GAINZ. What are you eating for breakfast? Drop it below!"

### Online vs Reality
Curates an image of effortless health and happiness. Reality: obsessive, anxious, lonely, hasn't had a carb she didn't photograph in three years.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother calls weekly worried about her eating
- Sister (still overweight) resents the constant "inspiration"

### Friends
- Mostly "collabs" - other influencers she doesn't actually like
- Lost real friends who got tired of being filmed

### Romantic
- Recently dumped by boyfriend who said she loved her phone more than him

### At the Hostel
- Judges the backpackers eating instant noodles
- Befriends a German girl briefly for a workout partner photo
- Makes enemies by hogging the bathroom for her morning routine

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 5 AM for her "sunrise routine" (filmed). Goes to breakfast buffet immediately when it opens. Chooses eggs over pastries. Posts content. Doesn't notice eggs are lukewarm and slightly off-color.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Finishing her perfectly composed breakfast photo, adding the fifteenth filter, not having eaten a single bite yet. Finally takes a forkful of eggs, thinking about the protein content.

### Final Thoughts
"This can't be happening. I eat so clean. I do everything right. This isn't fair. I'm supposed to be the healthy one. I'm supposed to—"

### Last Words
"I need... hospital... please... this can't be food poisoning... I don't eat bad food..."
